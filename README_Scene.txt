In my parse class, I will parse the file about the primitives, corresponding transformation, global, light. Then I use addPrimitive, setGlobal, addLight to set up for individual scene object. 
In the scene view class, after parse, the setting change will create all shapes according to primitive list created by parse function. In the renderGeometry, I will transform the shape then use shape.draw to draw.
