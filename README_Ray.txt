I do the extra credits, accelerated data structure of Oct-Tree and Muti-thread. 

To change the recursion depth, you can change the variable const int reflect_times = 2 in the  RayScene.h


If you do scene with large size of texture map, I recommend not to use Muti-thread, because it will be very slow, you can see the progress of render if you not using muti thread.
